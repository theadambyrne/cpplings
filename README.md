# cpplings

You might have heard of [golings](https://github.com/mauricioabreu/golings) or [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings),
this is a C++ spin-off to get you writing and reading C++. After setting up `cpplings` your task is to fix the tiny programs and learn the concepts as you.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theadambyrne/cpplings.git

cd cpplings
```

Note: This is a work in progress
